# Calling the Video Game API with the Ruby gem HTTParty

## What is this?
This is a small Ruby application that calls the [Video Game API](https://mighty-cliffs-81365.herokuapp.com/) (something else I made) using the [HTTParty](https://rubygems.org/gems/httparty) Ruby Gem.

## Using this application
There is a Gemfile with this repo which has the Ruby Gem of HTTParty, feel free to clone this repo and use Bundle!

This is a CLI application, follow the commands displayed in the terminal.
